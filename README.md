## 🚨 Educational Purpose Only

This tool is designed exclusively for academic research, educational purposes, and authorized security testing. Usage of this software for unauthorized penetration of computer systems, distribution of malware, or any malicious activity is strictly prohibited and may violate local, state, and federal laws.

## 🔧 Features

- **Executable Encryption**: Encrypt .exe files with AES-256 and protect the encryption key with RSA-2048
- **PDF Exploit Generator**: Convert executables into PDF files with embedded payload
- **File Decryption**: Decrypt previously encrypted files using the provided keys
- **Runtime Protection**: Advanced anti-debugging and anti-VM techniques to protect your payloads
- **Signature Morphing**: Dynamic code transformation to create unique file signatures every time
- **Antivirus Bypass**: Advanced obfuscation techniques to bypass VirusTotal and other antivirus solutions
- **Modern UI**: Dark mode interface with neon accents for a cybersecurity feel
